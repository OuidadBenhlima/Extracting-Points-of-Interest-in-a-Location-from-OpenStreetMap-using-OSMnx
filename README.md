This repository provides a Python script that extracts businesses and education locations in a given area from OpenStreetMap using the OSMnx library. The resulting points of interest are saved as a CSV file, including the name, address, and other relevant information. This repository is useful for anyone looking to extract points of interest from OpenStreetMap for a specific location and can be easily adapted to extract other types of locations or tags.
