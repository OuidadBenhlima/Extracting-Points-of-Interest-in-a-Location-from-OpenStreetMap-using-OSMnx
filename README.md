This repository provides a Python script that demonstrates how to extract points of interest in a location from OpenStreetMap using the OSMnx library. The script focuses on extracting businesses and education locations in a given area, and saves the results as a CSV file. The script uses the OSMnx library to download the OpenStreetMap data for the specified location, extract the points of interest based on their tags, and convert the data to a pandas DataFrame. The resulting CSV file contains the name, address, and other relevant information for each point of interest. This repository is useful for anyone who wants to extract points of interest from OpenStreetMap for a particular location, and can be easily adapted to extract other types of locations or tags.
